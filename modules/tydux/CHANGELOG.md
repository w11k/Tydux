        // one of:
        super(tydux, "test", new TestCommands(), 7);        // value
        super(tydux, "test", new TestCommands(), () => 7);  // functon

## Breaking changes in Tydux-Angular

Replaced `TyduxModule.forRoot()` with `TyduxModule.forRootWithConfig(configFactory: () => TyduxConfiguration)` and `TyduxModule.forRootWithoutConfig()`

# Version 10.4.0

In this version we simplified the API

- TyduxStore's type parameter for the state is optional now
  
  If you don't use a global AppState previously you have to write ```TyduxStore<any>```. Now you can obmit the type parameter and just write ```TyduxStore```
- Extended Facade constructor signature
  
  Instead of creating a mount point manually and pass it to facade's constructor, you can now just pass the TyduxStore.
  Before:
  ```
  constructor(tydux: TyduxStore) {
    super(tydux.createRootMountPoint('name'), 'name', new Commands(), new State()); 
  }
  ```
  After:
    ```
    constructor(tydux: TyduxStore) {
      super(tydux, 'name', new Commands(), new State());
    }
    ```
  Facade will create a mount point for you with the given name (second parameter).
